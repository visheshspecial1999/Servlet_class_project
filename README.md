# Servlet_class_project
Here I am uploading my class projects which I completed using servlet.
In these projects I have performed CRUDD operation with MySql database. 
where CRUDD means C-create R-read U-update D-display D-delete
Along with these projects you can also find the servlet notes in 'Servlet_Notes' folder.
